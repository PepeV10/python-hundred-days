# Day 5 - Loops & Data Aggregation
# Title: Feature: Calculate Average Student Height for Annual Health Report

# 1. Business Context & User Story:
# The data entry team has provided us with a list of student heights for the annual school health report. The data comes in as a single string of text from a legacy system, with each height separated by a aspace. Our system needs a script to process this string, calculate the average height, and prepare it for the report.

# User Story: "Aas a school administrator, I need to automatically calculate the average height from a list of manually entered heights, so that I can efficiently generate our annual health and wellness report without manual calculation errors."

# Technical Requirements & Constraints:
# Input: The script will receive a string of space-separated numbers (e.g., 156 178 165 171 187).
# Processing:
# * The provided started code will handle the initial conversion from a single string to a list of integers. Your work begins after that point.
# * To build foundational skills, the solution must use a for loop to process teh list.
# * The use of the buil-in sum() and len() functions for the primary calculation is prohibited for this ticket. The goal is to manually implement the logic of summing and counting using a loop.
# Output: The final calculated average height, rounded to the nearest whole number. 

# 3. Acceptance Criteria (Definitio of "Done"):
# * WHEN the user inputs "156 178 165 171 187".
# * THEN the script must output 171.
# * AND the code must correctly handle inputs with a different number of heights.
# * AND the core logic must be implemented using a for loop.

# Sprint: Day 5 - Loops & Data Aggregation
# Title: Feature: Find Highest Student Score

# 1. Business Context & User Story:
# Following the successful deployment of the height calculator, the academic department has a similar request. They have a list of student scores from a recent exam and need a script to quickly identify the highest score in the set without manually sorting or scanning the list.
# User Story: "As a teacher, I want to input a list of student scores and have the program tell me the maximum score, so I can establish the grading curve for my class."

# 2. Technical Requirements & Constraints:
# Input: The script will receive a string of space-separated numbers (e.g., "78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89").
# Processing:
# The provided starter code will handle the conversion from a string to a list of integers.
# The solution must use a for loop to process the list.
# The use of the built-in max() function is prohibited. You must implement the logic to find the maximum value yourself.
# Output: A formatted f-string: "The highest score in the class is: X", where X is the highest score.

# 3. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of "Done"):
# WHEN the user inputs "78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89"
# THEN the script must output "The highest score in the class is: 91".
# AND the core logic must be implemented using a for loop.

# [DO NOT MODIFY] - This block simulates receiving data from the academic system.
